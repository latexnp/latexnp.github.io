There has been a pretty big hype with jellybean for a while and a lot of my friends (okay not really. only the few who are into flashing custom roms and stuff) have already upgraded.
 So instead of working on all my assignments like I should have been doing, I just spent the last 5 hours or so flashing and screwing around with the OCT 13 build of PA for my Galaxy Note N7000.

Here's an extremely brief review.
<!-- more -->

###1. It's not that smooth.

Like the whole project butter hype thing? Yea... It's not that great.

Although it is very likely that this is simply due to the lack of a working hwcomposer for the Galaxy Note. Maybe if Samsung decided to release a few sources or hurry up and give us an official Jellybean TW rom or something, things could be very different.

 Flashing g.lewarne's HydraCore v6 beta 3 kernel made a little bit of a difference though.


###2. A few of my apps are broken.
 
Kind of annoying.

Swype kinda worked but things were a bit weird. Guitar Tabs were broken as well.
Also there is currently no working Polaris Office that is compatible with Jellybean. =.='


###3. The new Paranoid 2+ settings are quite frustrating.

Like the DPI slider things is kinda nice. But it can be quite fiddly and annoying.

Also the layout is in XXX px, which I find is quite annoying. I mean, I don't even know how each layout is going to look. Back in the CM9 version of PA, it was just a matter of setting the dpi to tablet and the ui to tablet.
 Now I have to carefully slide the dpi slider (they dont even have presets like 213, 240 etc) and then find a working px size. =.='

So frustrating.

So yea.
 After all that working flashing, fixing experimenting etc. I restored my nandroid backup and now I'm back on CM9 PA again.
 And I'm not missing JB that much.

Plus, now that I've satisfied my curiosity I promise I will work really hard for the rest of the week.
